* Much of meaning in life comes from a connection to others
* Friendship is a form of deep connection, for one can be lonely in a crowd
* Friendships are like plants
* Though friendships are not transactional
 * Different people bring out different versions of oneself
  * Want to be around those that bring out versions of myself that I like
  * Those that inspire, have passion, and are conducive to realizing self-growth
  * Some friends bring out the "old me", which can have mixed feelings
  * * Old is stagnant and flawed/problematic
    * But you can also grow and evolve with these friends, yielding a deeper connection
    *
